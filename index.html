            <p>When I was in high school, I knew I was interested in the sciences. That was the reason I got into the University of Athens, studying for a Physics degree. A few years had to pass however, to understand that I was far from what I really wanted to do. In high school, I had started messing around with application development, and after my initial trial with Physics, I knew I could do much more if I actually studied Computer Sciences.</p>
            <p>I entered the Informatics department of Athens University of Economics and Business and after a while, I realized the truth that for some reason no one wanted to say about academic studies: it is not the school, nor the degree or the subject that makes you a "scientist" and fuels your passion. Studying on your own and discovering what you like to work on, constantly pursuing your dreams and goals (goals that after a while might change); this is what makes you a professional, and this is something that the current market is lacking. I had to take some time to figure out that web development was something that intrigued me, even though my University had almost nothing to offer me with that particular road I wanted to take. I studied web dev on my own, practiced a lot on various projects and sat through innumerable tutorials and courses, all the while experimenting and questioning the "why's" and "how's".</p>
